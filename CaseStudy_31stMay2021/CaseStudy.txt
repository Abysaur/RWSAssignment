--------------------
 
Earlier this year Trisoft was taken over by SDL International.
As a result Trisoft is going through a rebranding phase, where all documents have to 
be updated to refer to us by our new name: SDL Trisoft.
 
* Write a C# console application, that:
 - Reads all XML files in a directory (where XML files are recognized as those with extension 
   'xml', 'xsl' or 'xslt')
 - replaces the term 'Trisoft' with 'SDL Trisoft' in all text content and title attribute values (so the values of attributes named 'title') of the document
 - Overwrites the original XML file with the new content, making a backup of the original file in
   a .bak file in the same directory.
 
 
* Write some unittests to test the replacement functionality in the documents.
 - Write unittest code to be run by either NUnit or MSTest
 - If you're not familiar with NUnit or MSTest, it's OK to write your own simple test client app or just describe the test cases.
 
 
* Extra remarks:
 - If a term in a file is already 'SDL Trisoft' it should  not be updated again.
 - Aside from the changes mentioned above, no other changes should be made to the document.
 - If a file with the .bak extension already exists, it may be overwritten to create the backup.
 - In case of a problem on a certain file, the program should print an error message and continue with the next file.
    The XML file that caused the error should not be updated in this case.
 - Think about XML namespaces
 
 
Example:
 
Some XML file's content before the run:
 
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <test title="This Trisoft will be updated">
        <line1>Trisoft has been renamed to SDL Trisoft</line1>
    </test>
 
After the run:
 
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <test title="This SDL Trisoft will be updated">
        <line1>SDL Trisoft has been renamed to SDL Trisoft</line1>
    </test>
